Ideas:

- Celebrity teaching Korean (Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading/Writing)
- Historical/Educational Videos 
- Shorts of mythical creatures/animals

Questions: 
1. Do we want to come up with our own video ideas, or have AI generate the ideas as well, based on channel theme?
2. How much of the Youtube short should be AI-generated? Some educational content uses real images to go with the voice over, or has non-AI footage as video background
3. Do we want to create multiple channels immediately? Or try to see if we can scale one channel up? Can we automate the creation of a new Google account + Youtube channel?
4. For more complex workflows, we can have a human check step in n8n.
