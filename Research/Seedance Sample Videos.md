Prompt:
Two animated stick figures sword fighting in a minimal white background. The first character has spiky green hair, inspired by anime swordsman Zoro, wielding two short swords. The second character is a dark stick figure holding a glowing neon-blue lightsaber. Fast-paced duel with dynamic motion and cinematic flow. First shot: wide camera angle showing both characters charging toward each other. Second shot: close-up of the glowing sword clashing with the Zoro-inspired twin swords. Third shot: slow-motion jump with spinning attack by the green-haired stick figure. Final shot: camera pulls back to show sparks flying as swords clash mid-air. Stylized 2D animation, fluid motion, black line art style.
