First shot: wide camera angle showing both characters charging toward each other. Second shot: close-up of the glowing sword clashing with the Zoro-inspired twin swords.

Updated Video Prompt:
In a wide shot, two stylized figures stand off on a white background. On the left, a young green-haired swordsman, barefoot, with wild spiky anime hair and two short katanasâ€”one in each hand. He wears green pants and a red sash. On the right, a dark, cloaked figure with glowing blue eyes holds a bright neon-blue lightsaber. The camera pulls back slightly as both fighters rush forward. Their weapons clash at center frame, sending off sparks. The camera cuts to a close-up of the green-haired fighter ducking under a sweeping lightsaber swing, then spinning behind the cloaked figure. In slow motion, the swordsman strikes from behind as the enemy turns. The final shot freezes mid-air just before impact, as light from the swords glows dramatically across the scene. Stylized 2D animation, clean and minimal aesthetic.

## Attempt 3: Same Image Prompt, but Simpler Video Prompt

Prompt:
In a wide shot, two stylized figures face off on a plain white background. On the left stands a barefoot green-haired swordsman in a red sash, holding two katanas in a cross-stance. On the right, a cloaked figure with glowing blue eyes grips a bright neon-blue lightsaber. The camera slowly zooms in as they sprint toward each other. In one dramatic moment, their blades clash with a burst of sparks. The camera cuts to a side angle: their weapons locked, glowing with energy. The scene ends with a slow pullback as both hold their stances, locked in a power struggle. Stylized 2D animation, clean black lines, glowing effects, cinematic mood.
