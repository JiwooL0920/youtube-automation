# Getting Started - Create Your First YouTube Short

This guide walks you through creating your first automated YouTube Short from idea to published video.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ Google Sheet named "Project" set up with proper columns
- ‚úÖ n8n workflow imported and configured
- ‚úÖ All API keys configured (OpenAI, Stability AI, ElevenLabs, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Google Sheets permissions configured for n8n

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Add Your Video Idea

1. **Open your Google Sheet** named "Project"
2. **Go to the next empty row** (usually row 2 if this is your first video)
3. **Fill in the required columns**:

| Column | What to Enter | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **ID** | Unique identifier | `PROJ_001` |
| **Idea** | Your video concept | `Explain how photosynthesis works in plants using simple analogies` |
| **Status** | Set to "Pending" | `Pending` |
| **Created** | Current date/time | `2024-01-15 10:30` |
| **Updated** | Same as Created | `2024-01-15 10:30` |

**Example Row:**
```
PROJ_001 | Explain how photosynthesis works in plants using simple analogies | Pending | 2024-01-15 10:30 | 2024-01-15 10:30 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
```

### Step 2: Wait for Concept Generation (5-10 minutes)

1. **The n8n workflow runs every 5 minutes** and will detect your pending project
2. **AI will generate a video concept** including:
   - Hook strategy for the first 3 seconds
   - Content structure breakdown
   - Visual storytelling approach
   - Timing allocation
3. **Status will change to "Concept Review"**
4. **Check the "Concept" column** for the generated JSON

### Step 3: Review and Approve the Concept

1. **Read the generated concept** in the "Concept" column
2. **In the "ConceptApproved" column**, select:
   - **"Yes"** - if you like the concept and want to proceed
   - **"No"** - if you want a completely different approach
   - **"Needs Changes"** - if you like it but want modifications

3. **If you selected "No" or "Needs Changes"**, add specific feedback in the "ConceptFeedback" column:

**Example feedback:**
- `"Make it more engaging for teenagers"`
- `"Focus more on the science behind it"`
- `"Add more visual examples"`
- `"Make the hook more dramatic"`

### Step 4: Wait for Script Generation (10-15 minutes)

Once you approve the concept:
1. **Status changes to "Script Review"**
2. **AI generates detailed script** with:
   - Scene-by-scene breakdown
   - Exact voiceover text
   - Visual descriptions for each scene
   - Timing and transition notes
3. **Check the "Script" column** for the generated content

### Step 5: Review and Approve the Script

1. **Review the script** in the "Script" column
2. **In the "ScriptApproved" column**, choose your approval:
   - **"Yes"** - script is perfect, proceed to visual generation
   - **"No"** - need major script changes
   - **"Needs Changes"** - minor adjustments needed

3. **Add feedback in "ScriptFeedback" if needed:**

**Example script feedback:**
- `"Slow down the pace in scene 2"`
- `"Make the language simpler"`
- `"Add more enthusiasm to the voiceover"`
- `"Change the example in scene 3"`

### Step 6: Visual Generation Process (15-20 minutes)

After script approval:
1. **Status changes to "Visual Generation"** then **"Visual Review"**
2. **AI creates scene images** in 3D papercut art style
3. **Multiple variations generated** for each scene
4. **Images optimized** for video conversion

### Step 7: Approve Visual Assets

1. **Review generated visuals** (links will be provided)
2. **In "VisualsApproved" column**, select your choice
3. **Provide feedback in "VisualsFeedback"** if changes needed:

**Example visual feedback:**
- `"Use brighter colors"`
- `"Make the main subject larger"`
- `"Add more background elements"`
- `"Change the viewing angle"`

### Step 8: Audio Generation (5-10 minutes)

With approved visuals:
1. **Status changes to "Audio Generation"** then **"Audio Review"**
2. **AI creates voiceover** using ElevenLabs
3. **Natural speech patterns** applied
4. **Timing matched** to video scenes

### Step 9: Approve Audio

1. **Listen to generated audio** (link provided)
2. **In "AudioApproved" column**, make your selection
3. **Add "AudioFeedback" if needed:**

**Example audio feedback:**
- `"Use a female voice instead"`
- `"Speak slower"`
- `"Add more emotion"`
- `"Fix pronunciation of 'photosynthesis'"`

### Step 10: Video Assembly (20-30 minutes)

With all assets approved:
1. **Status changes to "Video Assembly"**
2. **AI converts images to video clips**
3. **Synchronizes audio with visuals**
4. **Adds text overlays and transitions**
5. **Assembles final video**

### Step 11: Final Review

1. **Status changes to "Final Review"**
2. **Complete video ready** for your review
3. **AI generates optimized title and description**
4. **Check "VideoURL", "Title", and "Description" columns**

### Step 12: Final Approval and Publishing

1. **Review the final video** using the provided URL
2. **Check the generated title and description**
3. **In "FinalApproved" column**:
   - **"Yes"** - publish to YouTube immediately
   - **"No"** - make major changes
   - **"Needs Changes"** - minor adjustments needed

4. **Add "FinalFeedback" for any changes:**
- `"Perfect, publish it!"`
- `"Change the title to be more catchy"`
- `"Add more keywords to the description"`

### Step 13: Automatic YouTube Upload

Once you approve:
1. **Status changes to "Publishing"**
2. **Video automatically uploads to YouTube**
3. **Status changes to "Published"**
4. **YouTube URL appears in "YouTubeURL" column**

## üí° Pro Tips for Better Results

### Writing Effective Ideas
**Good Ideas:**
- `"Explain the water cycle using a story about a raindrop's journey"`
- `"Show how the human brain processes memories like a computer"`
- `"Demonstrate Newton's laws using everyday playground activities"`

**Avoid:**
- Too vague: `"Something about science"`
- Too complex: `"Advanced quantum mechanics theory and applications"`
- Too long: Ideas that would need more than 60 seconds

### Providing Helpful Feedback

**Specific Feedback Works Best:**
- ‚úÖ `"Make the hook more dramatic by starting with a surprising fact"`
- ‚ùå `"Make it better"`

**Reference Specific Scenes:**
- ‚úÖ `"In scene 2, show the plant from a closer angle"`
- ‚ùå `"Change the visuals"`

**Give Context:**
- ‚úÖ `"The voiceover sounds too formal for a young audience"`
- ‚ùå `"I don't like the voice"`

2. **AI will go back** and regenerate from scratch
3. **New concept/script/visuals** will be created

### Multiple Revisions
- You can request changes multiple times
- Each revision learns from your previous feedback
- The system remembers your preferences for future projects

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Status Stuck on "Pending"**
- Check that n8n workflow is running
- Verify Google Sheets permissions
- Ensure "Status" is exactly "Pending" (case-sensitive)

**No Concept Generated**
- Check OpenAI API key and quota
- Verify your idea is appropriate and clear
- Check n8n logs for error messages

**Approval Not Working**
- Use exact values: "Yes", "No", "Needs Changes"
- Check spelling and case sensitivity
- Ensure you're in the correct column

**Video Quality Issues**
- Provide specific feedback about what to improve
- Request regeneration if quality is poor
- Check API service status (Stability AI, Fal.ai)

### Getting Help
1. **Check the n8n execution logs** for detailed error information
2. **Verify all API services are working** by checking their status pages
3. **Review Google Sheets permissions** and sharing settings
4. **Check API quota usage** to ensure you haven't exceeded limits
